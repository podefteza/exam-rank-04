Assignment name:		vbc
Expected files:		*.c *h
Allowed functions:	malloc, calloc, realloc, free, printf, isdigit, write

Write a program that prints the result of a mathematical expression given as argument.
It must handle addition, multiplication and parenthesis. All values are between 0 and 9 included.
In case of an unexpected symbol, you must print "Unexpected token '%c'\n".
If the expression ends unexpectedly, you must print "Unexpected end of input\n".
The same rule applies if finding an unexpected '(' or ')'.
In case of a syscall failure, you must exit with 1.

Examples:
$> ./vbc '1' | cat -e
1$
$> ./vbc '2+3' | cat -e
5$
$> ./vbc '3*4+5' | cat -e
17$
$> ./vbc '3+4*5' | cat -e
23$
$> ./vbc '(3+4)*5' | cat -e
35$
$> ./vbc '(((((2+2)*2+2)*2+2)*2+2)*2+2)*2' | cat -e
188$
$> ./vbc '1+'
Unexpected end of input
$> ./vbc '1+2)' | cat -e
Unexpected token ')'$
