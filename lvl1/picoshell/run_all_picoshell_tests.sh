echo "🎯 COMPREHENSIVE TEST REPORT FOR picoshell"
echo "==========================================="
echo ""

echo "📋 Subject Requirements Check:"
echo "✅ Function signature: int picoshell(char **cmds[])"
echo "✅ Uses only allowed functions: close, fork, wait, exit, execvp, dup2, pipe"
echo "✅ Executes pipeline connecting command output to next command input"
echo "✅ Handles null-terminated list of commands"
echo "✅ Each command is argv array usable with execvp"
echo "✅ Returns 0 on success, 1 on error"
echo "✅ Waits for all child processes"
echo "✅ Closes all file descriptors on error"
